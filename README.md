This game is a work in progress using a tutorial to learn Unreal Engine 5 and its blueprint system. 

The tutorial can be found on GameDev.tv here: https://www.gamedev.tv/p/unreal-engine-5-blueprints

**Learned so far**
- Unreal Engine 5 (Basics, Navigation of Viewport, File Organisation, etc)
- Blueprint system (Basics, Variables, Functions, Execution Flow, etc)
- Animation Blueprints (AnimInstance, State Machines)
- Level Design (Actor Grouping, Lighting, Geometry Brushing, etc)
- Configuring Skeletal Meshes (Adding Sockets)

Further individual work is planned for this game once the tutorial is completed to further enhance my learnings using UE5.
